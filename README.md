## Hi, I'm Bartek

## About me:

From an early age I have been interested in technology.

I started pursuing my goal after finishing elementary school - I went to IT middle school.

At the beginning, I was particularly interested in hardware, I could assemble a computer and fix most things in middle school.

Then I went to an IT technical school, where I continued my development.

In technical school, I became more interested in softwear, but these were rather simple things, typically for ee09.

After graduating from technical high school, I went to study computer science, where I got really into programming especially in Python.

I currently learning Python and tools related to it at university, but also largely on my own.

On this profile I will post my own interesting projects that I will created when I learning.

Except programming and hardware I also interested in music, games, cooking and forest, especially in the mushroom picking season.
